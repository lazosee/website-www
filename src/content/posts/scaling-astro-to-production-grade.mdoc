## The Core Concept

Astro's strength lies in shipping zero-JavaScript by default. However, complex, dynamic features benefit from its "Islands Architecture," which only hydrates small components. This is the foundation of its performance at scale.

```jsx
// Example of a client-side interactive component (a React Counter Island)
// src/components/Counter.jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```


### A Nested Subheading

The choice of adapter dictates your scaling strategy. For global reach, Netlify or Vercel with serverless functions and CDN caching are key.

An ordered list
1. Configure your deployment using an Astro Adapter (e.g., @astrojs/netlify).
2. Utilize CDN caching headers (Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600).
3. If using SSR, minimize expensive operations within Edge functions.

A unordered list

- Pre-render all static routes `(output: 'static')`.
- **Italic** text Use image optimization services like Netlify Images or Cloudinary.
- *Bold text* Ensure your Markdown/Markdoc parsing is highly optimized.
