## The Core Concept

In this section, we dive deep into the main topic. Markdown is great for documentation and technical writing.

```typescript
const example = 'This is a code block inside markdown.';
function hello() {
  console.log(example);
}
```

### A Nested Subheading

An ordered list
1. Bullet points are easy.
2. **Bold text** is supported.
3. *Italic text* is supported.

A unordered list
- Bullet points are easy.
- **Bold text** is supported.
- *Italic text* is supported.

#### Blockquote too
> This is a quote, perhaps from a famous figure or source.
