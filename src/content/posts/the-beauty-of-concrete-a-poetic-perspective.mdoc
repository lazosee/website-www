## The Core Concept

Architects like Le Corbusier embraced béton brut (raw concrete) not as a cheap material, but as one with an inherent, honest texture—a tangible reflection of the construction process.

```txt
    // A poem fragment on concrete's texture

    The formwork scars, a memory
    Of liquid stone, now hard geometry.
    It holds the sky, unyielding, deep,
    Where human aspiration sleeps.
```

### A Nested Subheading

Brutalist buildings often evoke strong, polarizing emotions. Their monolithic presence demands contemplation, contrasting sharply with the ephemeral quality of glass and steel.

An ordered list

1. Texture: The visible aggregate and tie holes tell a story of fabrication.

2. **Italic** text Mass: They command a sense of permanence and grounded weight.

3. *Bold* text Light: Concrete surfaces catch light and shadow dramatically, changing mood throughout the day.

A unordered list

- Look for the Salk Institute by Louis Kahn for an example of sublime concrete.

- Consider concrete's duality: both raw and highly refined.

- Write a Haiku about a retaining wall.
