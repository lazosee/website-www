## The Core Concept

Semantic search understands the intent and context of a query, not just the keywords. This is achieved by converting both your content and the user's query into high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) that represent meaning.

```python
# Example: Generating a text embedding using a Python library (e.g., Sentence Transformers)
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
text_to_embed = "Mastering connection pooling is essential."
embedding = model.encode(text_to_embed)

print(embedding.shape) # Output: (384,)
```

## A Nested Subheading

The pipeline has three main stages: ingestion, querying, and ranking.

An ordered list

1. **Ingestion**: Parse your Markdoc files, chunk the text, and generate embeddings for each chunk.

2. **Storage**: Store the text and its corresponding vector in a Vector Database.

3. **_Italic_ text Querying**: Embed the user's query, search the database for the closest vectors, and return the matching content chunks.

A unordered list

- **Bold** text Chunking is crucial to avoid embedding overly long blocks of text.

- Use Cosine Similarity to measure vector distance.

- Consider a Hybrid Search model `(keyword + semantic)` for best results.
